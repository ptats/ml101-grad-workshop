# ML101 Workshop

This workshop is a little taste into machine learning, specifically deep learning for image classification. The approach that we will take is a 'code first' approach where you will be building and training your own image classifier before understanding what is going on under the hood.

## Prerequisites - can be completed on the day

* a laptop with google chrome or firefox
* google drive account - if you don't have a google drive account you can create one [here](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?continue=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.google.com%2FManageAccount&dsh=S-1694359826%3A1582007900873563&gmb=exp&biz=false&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp)
* Nice to have: local install of jupyter notebook (see instructions [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#install). If you are unable to install, that is fine, there are just one or two parts of the coding exercise that you will be unable to do

## How to run

### Step 1: Access Google Collab

Firstly you need a goolge account. You will need to do this step before proceeding otherwise the notebook will not work. You can create an account or sign in [here](https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/identifier?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=ServiceLogin).

### Step 2: Download notebook from Github

Navigate to the [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true) home page and select **Github**. Search by user **ptats** and select the **Image_Classifcation** notebook.

### Step 3: Configure GPU

You now need to tell google collab that you want to use a GPU. With the notebook displaying, go to runtime -> change runtime  and select the GPU option.

### Other Notes

* When you first run the notebook you will get a pop up warning, **Warning: This notebook was not authored by Google**. Select **RUN ANYWAY**.

* Make sure you save a copy to your drive. Navigate to file -> save a copy in drive...
